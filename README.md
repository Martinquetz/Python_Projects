## An EDA of US Used Cars Datasets
### Exploring Trends and Factors Affecting Pricing of USA Used Cars (1990-2015)
### **Project Overview** 
This project aims to conduct an exploratory analysis of USA used car data spanning the years 1990 to 2015. By examining factors such as car age, mileage, transmission type, and color, we seek to understand trends in car prices and identify factors influencing pricing in the US automotive market.

### **Data Sources and Description**
The dataset used in this project consists of information on USA used cars sourced from multiple online platforms and databases. It includes details such as car make, model, year, mileage, transmission type, color, and price. The dataset covers the period from 1990 to 2015 and comprises thousands of entries.

### **Tools Used**
Python programming language and its data analysis libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, were utilized for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis in this project. Jupyter Notebook was employed as the development environment for coding and documentation.

### **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
The dataset underwent thorough cleaning and preparation to ensure data quality and consistency. Tasks included handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing data formats, and encoding categorical variables. This process aimed to create a clean and structured dataset suitable for analysis.

### **Analysis**
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques were employed to uncover insights from the dataset. This involved visualizing distributions, trends, and correlations between variables using statistical measures and visualization techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.

### **Results and Finding**s
The analysis revealed several key findings regarding trends in car prices and factors influencing pricing. Notable insights include the impact of car age and mileage on pricing, differences in pricing based on transmission type, and potential correlations between car colors and prices.

### **Recommendations**
Based on the analysis findings, recommendations are provided for stakeholders in the automotive industry, including dealerships, manufacturers, and consumers. Suggestions may include adjusting pricing strategies, considering factors influencing pricing in inventory management, and understanding consumer preferences.

### **Limitations**
It's important to acknowledge the limitations of the analysis, such as potential biases in the dataset, limitations of the chosen analytical methods, and constraints of available data. These factors may impact the generalizability and reliability of the findings.
