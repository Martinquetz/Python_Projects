## An EDA of US Used Cars Datasets
### Exploring Trends and Factors Affecting Pricing of USA Used Cars (1990-2015)
### **Project Overview** 
This project aims to conduct an exploratory analysis of data on used cars in the USA from 1990 to 2015. The objective is to uncover insights into the trends of car prices over this timeframe and analyze the impact of factors such as car age, mileage, transmission type, and car colors on pricing. By examining a comprehensive dataset of used car listings, we seek to understand the underlying patterns and correlations contributing to pricing variations in the US automotive market during this period.

### **Data Sources and Description**
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggel. The dataset contains historical car auction sales prices scraped from outside internet sources. According to the author, the dataset was collected in 2015 and will not be updated. The dataset contains information on used cars in the USA which includes details such as car make, model, year, mileage, transmission type, color, price, etc. The dataset has ~559k entries covering the period from 1990 to 2015.

### **Tools Used**
Python programming language and its data analysis libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly were utilized for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis in this project. Jupyter Notebook was employed as the development environment for coding and documentation.

### **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
The dataset underwent thorough cleaning and preparation to ensure data quality and consistency. Tasks included handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing data formats, and encoding categorical variables. This process aimed to create a clean and structured dataset suitable for analysis.

### **Analysis**
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques were employed to uncover insights from the dataset. This involved visualizing distributions, trends, and correlations between variables using statistical measures and visualization techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, heat maps, and correlation matrices.

### **Results and Finding**s
The analysis revealed several key findings regarding trends in car prices and factors influencing pricing. Notable insights include the impact of car age and mileage on pricing, differences in pricing based on transmission type, and potential correlations between car colors and prices.

### **Recommendations**
Based on the findings of the analysis, recommendations are provided for stakeholders in the automotive industry, including dealerships, manufacturers, and consumers. Suggestions may include adjusting pricing strategies, considering factors influencing pricing in inventory management, and understanding consumer preferences.

### **Limitations**
It's important to acknowledge the limitations of the analysis, such as potential biases in the dataset, limitations of the chosen analytical methods, and constraints of available data. These factors may impact the generalizability and reliability of the findings.
